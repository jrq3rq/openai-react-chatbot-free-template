# OpenAI React App

This is a basic React app connected to the OpenAI API via a .env file. The app is responsive and highly customizable, all you have to do is connect your own API from the OpenAI website.

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/openai-react-app.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd openai-react-app
```

Install dependencies:

```

Create a .env file at the root of the project directory with your OpenAI API key:

```makefile
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
